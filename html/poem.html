				<h1>orange</h1>

				<p>
					If information is always command<br>
					then what is poetry?
				</p>

				<p>
					It is not information;<br>
					it does not signify anything.
				</p>

				<p>
					Rather, it is a surplus of meaning:<br>
					it is an orange, sitting on a front lawn,
				</p>

				<p>
					decomposing, threatening–no<br>
					not just threatening–
				</p>

				<p>
					becoming stinky, sticky, life-<br>
					giving ooze, no longer an "orange,"
				</p>

				<p>
					but rupture.
				</p>
