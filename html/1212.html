			<h1>foggy day</h1>

			<p>
				After I dropped Shao off at work today, I walked around fox point for an hour or so. I went down Wickendon to India Point Park, which was infested with runners brandishing their bright pink legs, and stood by the water for a while. It was foggy all morning. By noon, the fog gave way to a heavy rain.

			<h2>discrete: version 2 of ...</h2>

			<p>
				Listen. You must listen.<br>
				What do a square, a circle,<br>
				a boy, a girl, a tree, a fish<br>
				have in common?<br>
				They are all discrete,<br>
				like a light switch,<br>
				like yes or no.
			</p>

			<p>
				Be discrete. Can I count<br>
				on your discretion<br>
				when I say, Sometimes<br>
				I wake up not in a flash<br>
				but slowly, dream mingling<br>
				with reality for hours, days, years?<br>
				I'm always at the limit<br>
				of what I am, bending toward<br>
				the threshold.
			</p>

			<p>
				How discrete can you be<br>
				when I find that no void,<br>
				no death separates me from you<br>
				from my pen on the page<br>
				but the osmotic tug,<br>
				the vertiginous freefall?<br>
