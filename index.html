				<p>Welcome to Ev's web page. You can contact me <a href="mailto:evan.w.and@gmail.com">here</a>.</p>

				<p>On this site, I will be messing around with html, css, etc. with the ultimate goal of having a site where I can share my work that is not policed/farmed by M.Z.</p>

					<a href="html/bifo.html">Here</a> is a link to an essay I'm particularly fond of. It feels a bit off in light of the anti-climactic presidential transition taking place now (Dec 2020), but it's a good reminder: the forces that birthed Trump don't begin and end with Trump's presidency.

				<p>I hope you enjoy and will join my on my little journey :-)</p>
